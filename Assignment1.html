       <center> <h3>Abstract</h3></center>
        <center> <p>The fragment allocation design is an essential issue that improves the performance of<br>
                the applications processing in the Distributed Database systems <b>(DDBs)</b>. The database<br>
                queries access the applications on the distributed database sites and should be performed<br>
                effectively. Therefore, the fragments that accessed by queries are needed to be allocated<br>
                to the DDBs sites so as to reduce the communication cost during the applications<br>
                execution and handle their operational processing.</p></center><br>
                <h2>1.INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p > Various approaches have already been described the data allocation technique in distributed systems. Some
                    methods are limit in their theoretical and implementation parts. Other strategies are ignoring the
                    optimization of the transaction response time. The other approaches present exponential time of complexity
                    and test their performance on specific types of network connectivity.
                    The design of the DDBs enhances the performance of applications by minimizing the amount of irrelevant
                    data accessed by the applications [1], and by minimizing the amount of data transferred in processing the
                    applications [2]. There are two ways by which the performance of applications can be enhanced: grouping
                    sites and fragment allocation. Grouping sites of DDBs holds relevant data accessed by an application into a
                    group of sites.<b>Fragment allocation is the process of placing the fragments at the sites of DDBs to minimize
                    the data transfer cost and the number of messages during the applications processing </b></p>
                    <h2>2.BACKGROUND</h2>
     <P>Several approaches have been proposed for database partitioning and fragment allocations in DDBs. Son J.
        et al. [3] have introduced an adaptable vertical partitioning method in distributed systems. Yee W. et al. [4]
        proposed a method of grouping fragments based on a measure of inter-client sharing, which describes how
        many fragments each clientâ€™s subscription has in common with those of others Chun-Hung C. et al. [5] have explored the use of a genetic search -based clustering algorithm for
        data partitioning to achieve high database retrieval performance. They formulate the clustering
        problem in data partitioning as a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and propose 2 genetic
        operators SE and SP, as well as modified version of ER operators to solve the associated (TSP). A
        vertical partitioning technique is used in their algorithm, and they show that their model is applied
        to solve the horizontal partitioning problem.

    <h2>3.FRAGMENT ALLOCATION</h2>
    <p>
 To determine the fragment allocation at the <b>DDBs</b> clusters, we propose a new method developed from our
approach (Hababeh I. et al. [13]) and based on the data allocation and query processing cost functions that
find out precisely whether the fragment is allocated to or omitted from the cluster. This method attempts to
minimize the communication costs by distributing the global database over the sites and increasing
availability and reliability where multiple copies of the same data are allocated</p>
