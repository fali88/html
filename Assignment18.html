         <h1>It's GROUPING SITES!</h1>
         <br>
         <p class="p1">
            Grouping sites (clustering) is a method of grouping sites according to a certain criteria to increase the system I/O<br> performance and reduce storage overheads.Grouping sites into clusters helps in reducing the 
            communication costs<br> between the sites during the process of data allocation.We proposed a method for a clustering sites according to their communication cost, which determines whether or not a set of sites is assigned
            to a certain cluster, and  it considered<br> as a fast way to determine the data allocation to a set of sites rather than site by site.
         </p><br>
         <p class="p2">
            Two sites (Si,Sj) are grouped in one cluster if the communication cost between them is less than or
            equal to a Communication Cost Range (CCR); the number of communication units which is allowed
            for the maximum diffe-<br>rence of the communication cost between the sites to be grouped in the same
            cluster, this number is determined<br> by the network of the DDBs (Hababeh I. et al. [12]). Following is
            the definition of our clustering algorithm:Input:<br>Sites communication cost matrix CCR value The sites of DDBs
            Output: the set of clusters and their respective sites
         </p><br>
         <p class="p2">
       Grouping sites into clusters minimizes the communication costs bet ween the sites and improves the
       system<br> performance. The average communication cost between clusters and sites, and the average
       number of retrievals<br> and updates are considered in the computations of our fragment allocation method
       because the processing time<br> needed for average computations is less than the processing time when
       other techniques are used which depend,<br> on sorting sites according to specific fields. The system
       performance is enhanced by removing (cancel) the redundant fragments from the database clusters and
       by increasing availability and reliability where multiple copies of the same fragment are allocated, this
       will reduce the communication costs where the fragments are needed frequently

          <h1>FRAGMENT ALLOCATION</h1>
          <br>
           <p class="p1">
            To determine the fragment allocation at the DDBs clusters, we propose a new method developed from our<br>
            approach (Hababeh I. et al. [13]) and based on the data allocation and query processing cost functions that<br>
            find out precisely whether the fragment is allocated to or omitted from the cluster. This method attempts to<br>
            minimize the communication costs by distributing the global database over the sites and increasing
            availability<br> and reliability where multiple copies of the same data are allocated.
            </p><br>
            <p class="p2">
                Initially, fragments are allocated to all clusters having applications using that fragments, and the decision
                value<br> (D) of allocating a fragment to a cluster is computed as a logical value for the difference bet ween the
                cost of not<br> allocating the fragment to the cluster and the cost of allocating the fragment to the cluster. If the
                Cost of Not Allo-<br>cating the fragment to the cluster (the fragment handled remotely) is greater than or equal
                to the Cost of Allocating<br> the fragment to the cluster then the decision value is True and the fragment is
                allocated to the cluster, and If the<br> cost of not allocating the fragment to the cluster is less than the cost of
                allocating the fragment to the cluster then the decision value is False and the fragment is cancelled from the
                cluster.
            </p><br>
            <p class="p2">
                We illustrate our fragment allocation method in the following example, in which we propose the fragments
                and<br> their number of frequencies of retrieval and update requested from each cluster and its res pective sites
                (table 4),<br> the costs of space, retrieval, and update (table 5), and the following number of bytes which
                required for the compu-<br>tation of the update and retrieval ratios according to their use in the DDBs: 2 bytes in
                each unit of retrieval, 3 bytes<br> in each unit of update, and 5 bytes in each unit of communication.Clustering method is developed to group the
                sites<br> into clusters, which helps in reducing the communication costs between the sites during allocation
                process.
